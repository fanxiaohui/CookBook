based on software FEC techniques</a></h2>

<ul>
<b>Abstract:</b> Applications requiring the reliable distribution
of data to groups of clients would be supported perfectly by reliable
multicast protocols. In many cases, the problem of congestion
control (a major research issue otherwise) does not exist because
downlink bandwidth is ``owned'' or can be preallocated to a particular
server by independent means, but the problems of insuring reliable
data delivery to large groups, and adaptability to heterogeneous
clients, still remain.<br>
These problems can be solved at once with the clever use of FEC
techniques. In this paper we show the design of a Reliable Multicast
data Distribution Protocol (RMDP) that we have built using these
techniques, and discuss the implementation tradeoffs.  Experimental
results show that, albeit somewhat expensive, doing encoding/decoding
in software is affordable for speeds up to the MB/s range even on
desktop PCs. Slower machines can still receive at high speed, thus
optimizing network usage, by taking advantage of the fact that
decoding needs not to be done in real time. Finally, our RMDP can
work even without any feedback from the receivers, thus making it
well suited to mobile/wireless systems.<br>

<b>Abstract: </b>
Reliable communication protocols require that all the intended
recipients of a message receive the message intact.  Automatic
Retransmission Request (ARQ) techniques are used in unicast protocols,
but they do not scale well to multicast protocols with large groups
of receivers, since segment losses tend to become uncorrelated thus
greatly reducing the effectiveness of retransmissions.  In such
cases, Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques can be used,
consisting in the transmission of redundant packets (based on error
correcting codes) to allow the receivers to recover from independent
packet losses.
</p><p>

Despite the widespread use of error correcting codes
in many fields of information processing, and a general
consensus on the usefulness of FEC techniques within some of the
Internet protocols, very few actual implementations exist of the
latter. This
probably derives from the different types of applications, and from
concerns related to the complexity of implementing such codes in
software.  To fill this gap, in this paper we provide a very basic
description of erasure codes, describe an implementation of a
simple but very flexible erasure code to be used in network protocols,
and discuss its performance and possible applications.
Our code is based on Vandermonde matrices computed over $GF(p^n)$,
can be implemented very efficiently on common microprocessors, and
is suited to a number of different applications, which are illustrated
in the paper. An <a href="http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/vdm.tgz">implementation</a>
of the erasure code shown in this paper is
available from the author and running in the MB/s speed range when
implemented in software on a Pentium133.

<b>Abstract:</b> Forward Error Correction (FEC) is seldom used in
computer networks, because of perplexity in doing the necessary
encoding/decoding in software. We believe this diffidence to
originate from the fact that error control codes (which FEC is
usually based upon) are generally designed and presented stressing
their ability to correct {\em errors} rather than {\em erasures}
(i.e. missing data in known locations). Handling erasures is a much
simpler computational problem, and can be approached and solved
with much simpler techniques.
</p><p>
This paper has three main objectives. First, to put software FEC
in the right perspective by presenting the principle of operation
of erasure codes and showing that
software FEC is not exceedingly expensive. Second, to provide the
research community with a high performance, C implementation of
erasure codes capable to run at speeds in excess of
100 Mbit/s.  Third, to present a number of applications (some of
which have been developed, by the author or other researchers)
where software FEC can, despite its overhead, be used to actually
improve performance. These application cover slow, wireless networks
and fast wired networks, as well as unicast and multicast communication
protocols. Our conclusion is that software FEC is feasible and
useful in a number of applications, and does not require supercomputing
power to be implemented.
